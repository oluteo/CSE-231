    #  Computer Project #9

    #

    #  Algorithm

    #    get the securities and prices file pointer

    #    create a set and master dictionary from the securities file pointer

    #    edit the master dictionary by adding prices from the prices file pointer

    #       get the max price of a company

    #       find the max and average company price

    #       create a display function to properly display outputs

    #       in main:

    #               print banner and create master dictionary
    #               display options and ask user for input till a valid input is given
    #               for options:
    #                   option 1 prints the set of companies 
    #                   option 2 prints company symbols
    #                   option 3 prompts for a company symbol and displays max price of that  company
    #                   option 4 finds the max company price
    #                   option 5 prompts for a company symbol and displays average price of that  company
