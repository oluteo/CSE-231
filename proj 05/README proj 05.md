## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
This program reads data from an input file, processes the information about exoplanets, and determines if they are within the circumstellar habitable zone. It calculates various statistics, such as the number of stars and planets, average planet mass, and the closest rocky and gaseous planets within the habitable zone.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
- Python 3.x

## Usage<a name="usage"></a>
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter the name of the input data file (e.g., "KGF," "all," "small," or "singlestar").
3. Enter the maximum distance from Earth in light years to filter exoplanets within this range.

The program will then analyze the data and display various statistics and information about the exoplanets.

## Functionality<a name="functionality"></a>
The program performs the following functions:
- Reads exoplanetary data from a user-specified file.
- Calculates statistics such as the number of stars and planets with the most stars and planets, average planet mass, and planets in the circumstellar habitable zone.
- Identifies rocky and gaseous planets within the habitable zone and determines the closest planet of each type.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
No installation is required. Simply download the provided [Python script](computer_project_5.py) and run it in a Python environment.

## File Structure<a name="file-structure"></a>
- [proj05.py](proj05.py): The main Python script containing the program.
- Input Data Files (e.g., "KGF.csv," "all.csv," "small.csv," "singlestar.csv"): These files contain exoplanetary data used for analysis.
