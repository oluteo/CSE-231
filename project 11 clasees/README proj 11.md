## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
The `Volume` class is designed to represent a volume measurement, allowing you to work with different units and perform operations like addition and subtraction. It ensures the validity of volume objects by checking that they have a positive magnitude and valid units.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
- Python 3.x

## Usage<a name="usage"></a>
1. Import the `Volume` class from the provided Python script.
2. Create volume objects by instantiating the `Volume` class with magnitude and units.
3. Utilize the various methods and operations provided by the `Volume` class to work with volume objects.

## Functionality<a name="functionality"></a>
The `Volume` class provides the following functionality:

1. Create volume objects with a specified magnitude and units.
2. Check the validity of volume objects.
3. Get the magnitude and units of a volume object.
4. Convert volume objects between metric and customary units.
5. Compare two volume objects for equality.
6. Perform addition and subtraction on volume objects.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
1. Download the provided Python script ([proj11.py](proj11.py)).
2. Use the `Volume` class by importing it into your Python project.

## File Structure<a name="file-structure"></a>
